\section{Methodology}

The prospective solution was ultimately named \emph{Packet Courier} for reasons that the ensuing design documentation
aims to make clear. In summary, Packet Courier listens for packets being sent by nodes on its virtual network,
processing and rerouting them according to their listed destination and the associated conditions; just as a mail
courier would do analogously for letters and parcels. The metaphor also aligns itself well with the overall
motivations of the project, whereby postal services are largely seen as reliable infrastructure that operate silently
in the background, enabling people to send goods across seemingly vast distances without needing to worry about how
this is achieved. Indeed, these are the ideals that Packet Courier strives to embody, especially in light of
objectives 4) and 5).

Packet Courier has been designed and developed by leveraging philosophies from the \emph{lean development} school of
thought\cite{william_feld_lean_book, steve_blank_lean_blog}. This involved making Packet Courier a functional and
useful piece of software from the very first iteration, and continuing to ensure that this remained so with each new
feature. As a consequence, every supervisory meeting, informal peer review or user ``playtest'' would be a
meaningfully different experience, with something novel to demonstrate on each occasion. In this way, any feedback
could be readily taken on-board and implemented quickly. By contrast, if Packet Courier had been meticulously
designed from the bottom-up or the top-down, even the smallest changes in direction could risk rendering much of the
planning totally obsolete.

The simplest way to guarantee that Packet Courier provided users with tangible value from day one was to integrate an
application-programmer interface into the base simulation engine. That way, developers could always take advantage of
what Packet Courier had to offer, even if it was primitive. This ended up paying dividends down-the-line, as it was this
combination of design philosophy and system architecture that facilitated the development of Packet Courier's
emulation mode, which leveraged the base simulation APIs to further empower Packet Courier to manipulate authentic
UDP packets in real-time.
