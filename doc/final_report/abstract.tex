Modern day infrastructure is almost entirely built upon concepts of long-range communication. If any of us wish to
contact a family member, friend or colleague on the other side of the globe, then we scarcely hesitate to use one of
the many services that enable us to do so. In fact, it is nuisance if we encounter technical issues along the way. This
is somewhat of a social paradox, however, because the various algorithms and interweaving components that underpin
such powerful technologies are enormously complex. These fundamental protocols are expected to reliably deliver a
lengthy contract of communicative obligations, whilst deftly navigating the various pitfalls and obstacles that are
characteristic of the internet. Indeed, such implementations are difficult to test; finding a virtual landscape that
closely imitates the true chaos of the web is a hard problem. Of course, one could simply use the internet itself,
setting up machines based in London, Paris and Amsterdam, say. This is a costly operation, however, and one that is
inflexible with limited scope for a satisfying variety of test cases.
